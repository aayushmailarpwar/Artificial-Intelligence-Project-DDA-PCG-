Took a Master's level AI class in Fall 2022 - ECE 570 that included creating a thesis based project to show true understanding of AI concepts learnt throughout semester

In Fall 2023, three undergraduate students were selected to take ECE 570 - Artificial Intelligence for Computer Engineers and I was honored to be one of the students to take it. In the 4 month semester, we were to complete a "mock thesis" and complete this research utmost technical accuracy. I created an Infinite Runner game (think of temple run or subway surfers) where the difficulty of the game changes in three alternate fashions, in order to measure player performance throughout the process. 

The test bed was in Unity and C# was the language I had to use. Having little to no prior knowledge, I used my concepts of C, OOPs and game engineering to develop this test bed and successfully complete the game and succeed in the research question I was trying to prove.

The game objects including the "obstacles" follows an A* star approach to find the path out of a 5 column grid user is stationary and rows move towards you, to have a immersive effect. The Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment using the genetic algorithm and statistical analysis to come up with levels throughout the game. Both Online and Offline mode would do DDA based on player performance, but Online would do it within the same game whereas Offline would occur every 4 trials using the Genetic Algorithm. Finally options was Combined where both would work synchronously to improve player performance.
